## 🚌 Bronco Shuttle – Mobile Companion App
This project is a modern mobile app solution for the Bronco Shuttle system at Cal Poly Pomona. The existing web app is outdated, lacks user-friendliness, and provides limited real-time tracking capabilities. To address these issues, I built a fully functional mobile app from scratch using Flutter.

# 🚀 Key Features
📍 Live Shuttle Tracking – Real-time location updates powered by GPS from the driver’s phone.

⏱️ Accurate ETA Calculation – Passengers can see estimated arrival times based on the shuttle's current location.

🔒 Driver Login System – Drivers authenticate and share their location through the app for precise tracking.

📱 User-Friendly UI – A clean, responsive interface designed for students and visitors on the go.
